        "    \n",
        "   -  Logistic Regression and Linear Regression are both statistical methods used to model relationships between variables, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n",
        "   - Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, spam/not spam).\n",
        "      - It models the log-odds of the probability of the outcome as a linear combination of the input variables.\n",
        "      - The output is passed through a sigmoid function (also called logistic function), which squashes it into a range between 0 and 1.\n",
        "   - Linear Regression is a regression algorithm used to predict a continuous output (e.g., price, temperature, score) based on input variables.\n",
        "      -  It tries to find the best-fitting straight line through the data.\n",
        "      -  The relationship is modeled as a linear combination of the inputs.\n",
        "  - Use Linear Regression when your output is numeric and continuous.\n",
        "  - Use Logistic Regression when your output is categorical and binary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the mathematical equation of Logistic Regression.\n",
        "   - P(y=1/x) = 1/(1+e^-z)\n",
        "3. Why do we use the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.\n",
        "   - We use the sigmoid function in logistic regression because:\n",
        "        - It squashes the raw output into a range suitable for probability interpretation.\n",
        "        - It's mathematically convenient for training (differentiable),\n",
        "        - And it aligns with the goal of classification (especially binary classification).\n",

        "\n",
        "4. What is the cost function of Logistic Regression.\n",
        "   - The cost function of logistic regression measures how well the model's predicted probabilities match the actual class labels. Since logistic regression deals with classification and outputs probabilities, we cannot use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) like in linear regression. Instead, we use the Log Loss or Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.\n",

        "5. What is Regularization in Logistic Regression? Why is it needed.\n",
        "   - Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression (and other machine learning models) to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models.\n",
        "   - In logistic regression, regularization works by adding a penalty term to the cost function to shrink the model’s coefficients (weights). This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
        "   - Without regularization:\n",
        "        - The model might learn very large weights to fit the training data perfectly.\n",
        "        - This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.\n",
        "        - Regularization helps keep the model simpler and more generalizable.\n",
        "6. Explain the difference between Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regressionC\n",
        "   - 1. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):\n",
        "          - Shrinks coefficients toward zero, but never exactly zero\n",
        "          - Keeps all features but reduces their influence\n",
        "          - Works well when all features are relevant and multicollinearity is present\n",
        "          - You have many small/medium-sized effects,You don’t want to remove any features completely\n",
        "  -  2. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):\n",
        "           - Can shrink some coefficients exactly to zero\n",
        "           - Performs feature selection by eliminating irrelevant variables\n",
        "           - Can result in sparse models\n",
        "           - You suspect only a few features are important\n",
        "           - You want a model that's easy to interpret\n",
        "  - 3. Elastic Net Regression (L1 + L2 Regularization):\n",
        "           - 𝜆 controls overall strength of regularization.\n",
        "           - Combines the benefits of both Lasso and Ridge\n",
        "           - Useful when you have many correlated features\n",
        "           - Can perform both shrinkage and feature selection\n",
        "           - You want flexibility between Lasso and Ridge\n",
        "           - Features are highly correlated\n",
        "\n",
        "7. When should we use Elastic Net instead of Lasso or Ridge.\n",
        "   - Use Elastic Net When:\n",
        "       - Features Are Highly Correlated\n",
        "       - You Have More Features Than Observations (p > n)\n",
        "       - You Want Feature Selection + Stability\n",
        "       - You’re Not Sure Which to Choose\n",
        "8.What is the impact of the regularization parameter (λ) in Logistic Regression.\n",
        "  - The regularization parameter λ in logistic regression controls the strength of regularization — in other words, how much penalty is applied to the model’s coefficients (weights) during training.\n",
        "  - Larger λ makes the penalty term dominate, pushing weights closer to zero.\n",
        "  - As λ↑:\n",
        "      - Model becomes simpler\n",
        "      - Decision boundary becomes less flexible\n",
        "      - Risk of underfitting increases\n",
        "  - As λ↓:\n",
        "      - Coefficients can grow large\n",
        "      - Model may fit noise in the training data\n",
        "      - Risk of overfitting increases\n",
        "9. What are the key assumptions of Logistic Regression.\n",
        "   - Key Assumptions of Logistic Regression:\n",

        "11.  What are Classification Evaluation Metrics.\n",
        "     - Classification evaluation metrics are used to measure how well a classification model performs. Since classification predicts categories (like spam vs. not spam), these metrics assess how accurate or effective those predictions are.\n",

        "12.  How does class imbalance affect Logistic Regression.\n",
        "     - Class imbalance happens when one class (usually the \"negative\" or majority class) significantly outnumbers the other (minority) class in your dataset. This imbalance can seriously affect the performance of logistic regression (and other classifiers).\n",
        "    - How Class Imbalance Affects Logistic Regression\n",

        "13. What is Hyperparameter Tuning in Logistic Regression.\n",
        "    - Hyperparameter tuning in logistic regression is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters (settings that are not learned from data but set before training) to optimize the model’s performance.\n",
        "    - Some common hyperparameters include:\n",
        "        - Regularization parameter λ or inverse C Controls the strength of regularization (how much to penalize large coefficients).\n",

        "          How many iterations the solver runs before stopping.\n",
        "14. What are different solvers in Logistic Regression? Which one should be used.\n",
        "    - In logistic regression, a solver is the optimization algorithm used to find the best-fitting model parameters (coefficients). Different solvers have different strengths, limitations, and performance characteristics depending on the data size, number of features, and regularization type.\n",
        "    - liblinear: Good for small datasets and L1 regularization.\n",
        "    - lbfgs: Default, efficient, but only L2 penalty.\n",
